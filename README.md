## About ShaniAI

ShaniAI is revolutionizing decentralized application development by building foundational tools that eliminate complexity and accelerate developer onboarding on blockchains. Our mission is simple: **Start building, not boilerplate.**

---

## Development Status

**This project is currently under active development and not ready for production use.** The codebase is experimental, features are incomplete, and breaking changes are expected. We're building the foundation for multi-chain dApp development tools.

**Timeline**: Alpha release expected Q4 2024, with stable release in Q2 2025.


## The Problem We're Solving

Developers face three major challenges in blockchain development:

- **Endless Scaffolding**: Hours wasted on boilerplate code just to get started
- **Multi-Chain Maze**: Supporting multiple blockchains means juggling different SDKs, APIs, and deployment processes
- **Repetitive Logic**: Writing the same wallet connections, transaction handling, and state management over and over again

## Our Solution: Manifold OS

**Status**: Under Development

Manifold OS is our flagship product - a comprehensive platform for multi-chain dApp development that will generate production-ready applications with a single command.

### Planned Features

- **Zero to Production in Minutes**: Generate complete, production-ready dApp foundation instantly
- **Built for Multi-Chain World**: Support multiple blockchain ecosystems from day one
- **Enterprise-Grade**: Security-first architecture with comprehensive error handling
- **Developer Experience**: Modern tooling with TypeScript support and optimized build pipeline

## Future Vision: ShaniAI Canvas

Beyond Manifold OS, we're building **ShaniAI Canvas** - an intelligent visual interface where developers can:

- Design dApp architecture through natural language
- Generate complete applications with AI assistance
- Deploy across multiple chains with unified tooling
- Manage complex multi-chain applications from a single interface

## Planned Tech Stack

| Core Technologies | Blockchain Integration | Development Tools |
|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| TypeScript | Multi-Chain SDKs | AI-Powered CLI |
| React/Next.js | Smart Contract Templates | Visual Designer |
| Node.js | Cross-Chain Bridges | Automated Testing |
| WebAssembly | Wallet Integrations | Deployment Pipeline |

## Getting Started (When Available)

### Prerequisites (Planned)

- **Node.js** (v18+)
- **Git** for version control
- **Docker** (optional, for containerized development)
- **Wallet** (MetaMask, WalletConnect compatible)

### Installation (Coming Soon)

```bash
# Install ShaniAI CLI globally
npm install -g @shani-ai/cli

# Create new multi-chain dApp
shani create my-dapp --chains ethereum,polygon,arbitrum

# Start development
cd my-dapp
shani dev
```
